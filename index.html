				<!-- The Text Information -->
				<p>In this project, we aimed to capture the painterly aesthetic and vibrant colors of Van Gogh's <a href="https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0047V1962">The Bedroom</a> and <a href="https://krollermuller.nl/en/vincent-van-gogh-terrace-of-a-cafe-at-night-place-du-forum-1">Café Terrace at Night</a> while allowing a viewer to explore reflections and lighting in such a space.</p>
				
				<h3>Handling the Component Images</h3>
				
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>From a technical perspective, we composed this shader from six (6) image maps:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Normal Map</li>
							<li>Depth Map</li>
							<li>Reflectivity Map</li>
							<li>Light Color Map</li>
							<li>Dark Color Map</li>
							<li>Environment Painting</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The process of creating these maps began in Blender. First, we created simple utensil models based on our inspiration photo, and layed them out on a plane. Then we created a material that converts the world-space normal information into camera-space, and outputs those converted normals as color on the assigned objects.</p>

					<div class="column">
						<div class="polaroid">
							<img src="imgs/shader_graph.png" width=50%>
							<div class="polaroid_note">
								The shadergraph information for the normals material.
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="spacer"></div>

				<p>To get the painterly effect, we used the <a href="https://tradigital.gumroad.com/l/lpqoz?layout=profile">Tradigital Live Paint Filter Plugin</a> on top of the Blender scene in order to render out that normal information as though it had been painted by hand. Having these normals faceted in such a way allows the light information to bounce for an entire stroke rather than just for a pixel, and is a key component of the painterly aesthetic we were attempting to emulate.</p>
				
				<div class="polaroid_alt">
					<img src="imgs/final_normals.png" width=50%>
					<div class="polaroid_note">
						The final normal map.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="spacer"></div>

				<p>In the same vein, we used the Live Paint Filter with simple, emissive color materials in order to generate the Light and Dark Color Maps. Initially, we just used hypothetical diffuse color information for the light color map, then darkened that for the dark color map. After experimentation, though, we found that the results were closer to Van Gogh's work if we instead treated the light color map as a highly saturated color mostly abstracted from the material properties, then chose the dark colors by lowering the value and shifting the hue to a cooler color (making sure to maintain a high saturation).</p>

					<div class="column">
						<div class="polaroid">
							<img src="imgs/final_light.png" width=50%>
							<div class="polaroid_note">
								The final light color map
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<div class="polaroid_alt">
							<img src="imgs/final_dark.png" width=50%>
							<div class="polaroid_note">
								The final dark color map.
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="spacer"></div>

				<p>The depth map was used to generate the cast shadow information in the final shader, and the reflectivity map was used to define which parts of the image would be treated as reflective surfaces.
				<br>
				<br>
				These two maps were not created using the Live Paint Filter primarily for stylistic reasons. We found in testing that there was more interesting material interactions when the reflectivity map was separated from the paint strokes. It resulted in small instances where the reflectivity within one stroke seems to ramp up or down and reminded us of the cases where a stroke of paint might transition from one color to another as it blends.
				<br>
				<br>
				Instead, the depth map was generated by outputting a depth pass from blender and remapping it from meters to a 0.0-1.0 color scale, and the reflectivity map was created by just outputting an alpha pass of just the utensil geometry.</p>

							<div class="polaroid_note">

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="spacer"></div>

				<p>In addition to those six maps, we also painted our own image for the environment that could then be reflected in the utensils. This painting was heavily based on the aforementioned <i>Café Terrace at Night</i>, and we chose the palette based on a combination of that painting with the colors we were getting from our lilght and dark color maps (which themselves were based on <i>Café Terrace at Night</i>).
				<br>
				<br>
				We attempted two ways of having the user manipulate the environment, and two methods of transforming the environment map. First, we applied 2D rotation transformations on the environment map based on the X position of the user's mouse in the window. This worked, but was unwieldy due to the user <i>also</i> controlling the light with their mouse position. For these reasons, we switched to manipulating the rotation via a slider beneath the WebGL window.
				<br>
				<br>
				Once we had better control over the rotations, we realized that having the image rotate in 2D wasn't providing a very coherent output. Since we were partially inspired by the "visual development" (V-Dev) rigs seen in animation and game development, we decided to switch tracks and rotate the environment map around the scene as though it were on the interior of a cylinder. In order to approximate this effect, we instead tied the left-right <i>transformation</i> of the environment to the slider (looping the uv information with a modulo operation).</p>
